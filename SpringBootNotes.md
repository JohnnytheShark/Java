# Spring Boot 

The three core features that Spring Boot builds on is dependency management, simplified deployment, and autoconfiguration

## Build Tools
Typically we see Maven or Gradle 

(Apache) Maven is a popular and solid choice for a build automation system. Build is pom.xml

Gradel uses DSL (Domain Specific Language) to produce a build.gradle build file
Gradel uses Groovy or Kotlin Programming Languages

## Languages 
Spring can either be built in Java or Kotlin

## Getting Started
Go to a Spring Initializer: https://start.spring.io
This will generate the project folder structure
